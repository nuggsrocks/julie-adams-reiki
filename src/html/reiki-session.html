			<p>
				The practitioner will spend some time before the session to explain what will happen in the session and share some common reactions to Reiki. The practitioner will also discuss what issues brought the person in to receive Reiki and answer any questions they may have. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Reiki is shared in a peaceful, quiet setting. The person may lie on a table or sit in a chair. The person is fully clothed and a blanket can be used for added warmth and comfort. Soft music may be played in the background depending the on the personâ€™s preference.
			</p>

			<p>
				The practitioner places their hands lightly on or slightly above specific parts of the body for the sharing of energy. The energy sharing session takes about 30-45 minutes. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The person receiving Reiki may feel many different sensations such as feeling warmth or coolness, seeing colors or feeling calm and relaxed. It is also not uncommon for someone to not feel much of anything at all. These are all perfectly normal reactions.
			</p>

			<p>
				After the session, the practitioner will spend more time talking with the person about their experiences. Water is recommended after a session.
