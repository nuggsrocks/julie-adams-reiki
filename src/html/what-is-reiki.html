				Reiki is a Japanese healing energy technique used for the treatment of self and others. It was developed in the early 1900’s by a Japanese Buddhist named Mikao Usui. The word Reiki comes from the Japanese word “Rei” meaning Universal Life, and “Ki” which means energy.

				Reiki is the energy that flows through all living things. When energy is blocked, it can lead to emotional, physical and spiritual imbalances. During a Reiki session, energy is shared by a trained practitioner through touch and intention to promote the health of the body, mind and spirit. Common reactions after a Reiki session include feelings of relaxation, a sense of calm, pain relief and a sense of well being.

				Reiki is not a substitute for medical care but is used as a supplement to medical treatment. Reiki is provided by practitioners in private practice as well as in hospitals throughout the world.
