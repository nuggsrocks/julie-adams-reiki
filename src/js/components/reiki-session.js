      <h2>Reiki Session</h2>

      <p>
        The practitioner will spend some time before the session to explain what
        will happen in the session and share some common reactions to Reiki. The
        practitioner will also discuss what issues brought the person in to
        receive Reiki and answer any questions they may have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reiki is shared in a peaceful, quiet setting. The person may lie on a
        table or sit in a chair. The person is fully clothed and a blanket can
        be used for added warmth and comfort. Soft music may be played in the
        background depending the on the personâ€™s preference.
      </p>

      <p>
        The practitioner places their hands lightly on or slightly above
        specific parts of the body for the sharing of energy. The energy sharing
        session takes about 30-45 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person receiving Reiki may feel many different sensations such as
        feeling warmth or coolness, seeing colors or feeling calm and relaxed.
        It is also not uncommon for someone to not feel much of anything at all.
        These are all perfectly normal reactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the session, the practitioner will spend more time talking with
        the person about their experiences. Water is recommended after a
        session.
