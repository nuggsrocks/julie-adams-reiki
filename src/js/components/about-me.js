			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
				I worked for 40 years as a nurse specializing in neonatal intensive care. During that time, I took a Therapeutic Touch course and found that it seemed to help babies to calm during stress. After retiring, I attended an introductory session on Reiki. I had no experience with Reiki but I knew some people who had and they all had positive things to say about it. From my first experience, I felt a sense of calm and peace and I wanted to learn more.
			</p>

			<p>
				I started taking Japanese Reiki Level 1 from Dr. Sally Littleton in the spring of 2018. It was a great experience. I continued on and earned my Reiki Levels 2 and 3 with Dr. Littleton over the next year and a half. Having a daily Reiki practice helps me to manage stress and feel better physically, emotionally, and spiritually. My family and friends feel that it helps them when I practice hands on sessions with them. I find that it makes me feel happy and more connected to Reiki when I share it with others so I started on my journey of starting my own practice.
